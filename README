THE PLAN!!!...more or less...

VER 0: Command-Line -- Simple no feedback
VER 1: Command-Line -- w/ feedback
VER 2: GUI -- probably with PyGame

Gameplay:

Point based.
10 attempts to solve word, after initial guess (since it is pretty much impossible to guess alright on first try)
More points for less tries
Feedback on each answer:
    Command-Line Versions:
        U: Letter is higher in the alphabet (closer to 'A')
        D: Letter is lower (closer to 'Z')
        R: Letter is within 5 of the guess to the right
        L: Ditto but left
        C: Letter is within 5 of guess in this spot
        X: Wrong!!! -- Allows computer to be a jerk on occasion
        Any lower-case letter is the correct letter in the correct spot
        
    Each of these options, has a weighted chance of occuring, since a guess can fall into several categories of responses
